Command-line tool to manipulate a PATH variable.

== Motivation

The format of the PATH environment variable with colon separated values allows you easy to add a new path at the front or end.
But all other operations(swap, remove) require the help of an editor and some manual moves.
pato is my approach to solve this problem.

== Usage

List all paths that are stored in a PATH variable:

----
$ pato -e list                // lists the values of the PATH variable from the environment
$ pato list                   // same as -e
$ echo $PATH | pato -i list   // lists the values of the PATH variable from the input stream
----

Manipulate a PATH variable and set it as the environment PATH variable:

----
$ PATH=$( pato push $PWD )
$ PATH=$( pato pushf $PWD )
$ PATH=$( pato insert 2 $PWD )
$ PATH=$( pato remove 3 )
$ PATH=$( pato swap 2 6 )
----

All commands that manipulate a PATH variable write the result as a line to the output stream.
So it is easy to chain commands together:

----
$ PATH=$( pato push $PWD | pato -i push $PWD/bin | pato -i push $PWD/tools )
----

Check the manpage in the doc directory for further information about the usage.
